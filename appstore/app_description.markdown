We also allow you to hack the Hacker News feed to return the hottest news, according to you.  Do you always want the freshest news?  Or, do you prefer a balance between freshness and stories with high up-votes?  You set it up, or let us pick a default.

This is just the begginging.  What started as a weekend project is something we'd like to add to.  Please help us keep Little Hack fresh, and full of great features!
