Little Hack (author: Andrew Little)
================================================

Little Hack started as a weekend project to create an application that I felt was missing from the app store.  I wanted a single use app that would allow me to quickly read through Hacker News articles without having to launch Safari and pinch and pan my way around the site.

The app came together quickly, but has since been rejected by the App Store review team (twice).  They argued that the app was too simplistic and really only served as a list of links to web conent.  This is true, though I still think many would find this app more fun to use than Safari and more useful than a typical fart/flashlight app.  To be fair, the review team is simply following the publically available app review guidelines and I have decided to provide the app as an open-source distribution, via Github.

Please enjoy.
